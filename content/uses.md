# `/uses` Page

Nice find! ðŸ™Œ `/uses` is a nice sort of personal-website standard where people
post stuff they use to do their work or just in their life. I swear it is, but I
can't find a link about this anywhere now.

## Hardware

  * I use a 2021 14-inch M1 Pro MacBook Pro. Love it.
  * I have an iPad Air that I use to draw slides (with the Apple Pencil) and
    watch movies, and sometimes do some shopping.
  * My phone is an iPhone 15 Pro Max. I don't really care about which computer
    or iPad I use, but I'm a sucker for phones and I love the iPhone.

## Software

I'm a software engineer, so I use computers and software a lot, but who doesn't
these days anyway.

### Computerz

I use macOS as my main OS.

#### macOS Apps

  * [VS Code][vscode] as my main text editor.
  * [iTerm 2][iterm] as my terminal.
  * [1Password] for password management. I pay for a family subscription, and I
    think 1Password might be my favorite piece of software ever?
  * [Dash] for consulting documentation. It's an app that aggregates
    documentation from different software, programming languages, and ecosystems
    (it supports [hex.pm](https://hex.pm) packages!!). It lets you search though
    everything. Just awesome.
  * [Obsidian] for taking notes.
  * **Mail.app** (the default) for email.
  * [Fantastical] for calendars. I pay for a subscription for this and love it.
  * **Keynote.app** for giving talks.
  * [TablePlus] for talking to databases.
  * [Raycast] to do *a lot of stuff*. I launch apps with it, run little scripts
    that I wrote as extensions, use it for clipboard management, for snippets,
    as a calculator, and probably more. I used to use [Alfred] for this but nowadays Raycast has a bunch more extensions.

I also use a lot of little utilities here and there to make life on macOS more
pleasant.

  * I use [Magnet] to move my windows around.
  * [AltTab] lets me command-tab my way around much better than the default.
  * [CleanShot X][cleanshot] to take screenshots. I'm a nerd for screenshots.
  * [Klack] (and this is silly) for having mechanical-keyboard sound in my
    headphones when I type on my normal Apple keyboardâ€”which I prefer for the
    actual typing.
  * [Hand Mirror][handmirror] to check that I'm pretty before meetings.
  * [Timing] to track what I do when looking at screens. This is cool because
    I'm a nerd for data about what I do, but also a bane because it shows me how
    much time I just screw around.

#### iOS/macOS/iPadOS Apps

There are a bunch of apps I use cross-device and outside of doing software
development.

  * [HiCoffee] for tracking caffeine intake. I'm a data nerd, again.
  * [Pocket Casts][pocketcasts] for listening to podcasts.
  * **Reminders.app** (the default Apple one) for reminders and grocery shopping
    and house-cleaning chores. I share some lists with my wife.
  * My wife and I have a [YNAB] subscription. YNAB is awesome.
  * I use [Mela] for storing and archiving recipes. I like to cook. I used to
    use [Paprika], but Mela is prettier and seems to be more actively maintained.
  * [Whering] is pretty great for tracking your wardrobe, how much you use it,
    and so on.

## Traveling

My biggest passion in life is probably traveling. I like to optimize the things I can when traveling, so this is my favorite section in this page.

### Software

  * Even though I hate it and it's a battery hog, I use **Google Maps** really
    *all the time*. It's the only place where I trust transportation, reviews,
    and opening times in most places around the world. I don't use it for
    directions much because I rarely drive when traveling. Apple Maps is nicer
    and doesn't drain battery, but here in Italy it's pretty much useless. Also, Google Maps recently (and *finally*) added support for custom icons and emojis for custom lists, so now this is also a good database of visited places for meâ€”and restaurants, pubs, whatever.

  * [TripIt] is the place where I store all the info about the trips I do. Plane
    tickets, hotels, train tickets, parking, restaurant reservations, whatever.
    Also super handy because I can share trips with my wife, both as a viewer
    and as a traveler, so that she has access to everything too.

  * I use [Flighty.app][flighty] to manage my flights. It's the stupidest sixty
    bucks (you read correctly) I spend out of every single cent that goes out of
    my bank account, but man do I love this app.

  * When I travel with friends, I love to use [Splid] to track expenses. It
    makes it so easy to just pay for stuff and then figure it out later.

  * I mostly use TikTok (yep, TikTok) for finding out places to visit,
    restaurants, and whatnot. I also Google around, sure, but TikTok has a lot
    of interesting content when it comes to travel.

  * I recently discovered [Airalo] for buying travel eSIMs. My life is changed
    forever.

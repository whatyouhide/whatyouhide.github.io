Hi. I'm Andrea *(he/him)*.

I'm a person from Italy 🇮🇹, working as a software engineer.

Currently, I'm a platform software engineer at <a href="https://knock.app"
target="_blank">Knock</a>, a notification and customer-engagement infrastructure
company. I work with the most fantastic team. ✨

Throughout my whole career, I've been active in **open-source software**. I've
been a member of the core team of the <a href="https://elixir-lang.org"
target="_blank">Elixir programming language</a> since 2016, and I've written and
published [several][redix] [widely][gettext]-[used][stream_data]
[libraries][mint] for the Elixir ecosystem.

I'm also an active **public speaker and trainer**. You can see a few of my talks
{{ youtube_playlist_url(text="on YouTube") }}.

At some point, I co-wrote a **book** about testing practices in Elixir. You can
find it [here][testing-elixir]. At a later point, I also wrote a book about network programming
in Elixir called [*Network Programming in Elixir and Erlang*][network-programming-with-elixir].

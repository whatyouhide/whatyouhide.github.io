Hi. I'm Andrea.

I'm a software engineer from Italy. Currently, I work at <a
href="https://apple.com" target="_blank">Apple</a> to help towards the plan to
make all products carbon neutral <a href="https://apple.com/2030"
target="_blank">by 2030</a>.

Throughout my whole career, I've been active in open source software. I've been
a member of the core team of the <a href="https://elixir-lang.org"
target="_blank">Elixir programming language</a> since 2016, and I've written and
published several widely-used libraries for the Elixir ecosystem.

I'm also an active public speaker and trainer. You can see a few of my talks {{

# Second Opinion Request

## Question
Revise the design slightly so that the background of the homepage and of the blog posts (not the post card itself) has a very subtle grid, like 80s computer style, but still fitting within the aesthetics of the existing design (which is my very personal brand)

## Instructions
You are providing an independent second opinion. Be critical and thorough.
- Analyze the question in the context provided
- Identify risks, tradeoffs, and blind spots
- Suggest alternatives if you see better approaches

- Structure your response with clear headings
- Keep your response focused and actionable
